- Each die type is represented by a corresponding 3D model using SceneKit.
- Unique geometries for each dice type:
  - **D4**: Pyramid  
  - **D6**: Cube  
  - **D8**: Octahedron  
  - **D10**: Pentagon-based approximation  
  - **D12**: Dodecagon  
  - **D20**: Icosahedron  


### üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable Setup**
- Easily select dice type and quantity from the intuitive interface.
- Add multiple dice types to a single roll for complex gaming scenarios.

### üì± **SwiftUI Integration**

TODO:
[] Swap models to 3d
[] Add physics scene that rolls dice
[] Allow dice to have their colors changed / set
[] Add a tally so you know totals of each dice set, totals of all
[] Add a screen that shows the dice rolls entirely and allows you to re-roll ones you pick
